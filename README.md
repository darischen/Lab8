When using graceful degradation, application developers develop using current functionality standards while maintaining backwards compatibility with older systems with limitations. Service workers are similar to graceful degradation in the fact that it is a fallback when something goes wrong or is limiting the current application due to improper or non-standard features. Service workers provide functionality even when the internet connection is unavailable, similar to how graceful degradation might provide a less intensive website to accomodate lower end systems.
